## Introduction

This project is a web-based version of the classic Snake game, implemented in JavaScript and hosted using the Express framework. The game features a simple yet engaging interface where players can control a snake, guiding it to collect items and grow in size while avoiding obstacles.

It is my first time using Canvas, so probably it will be improve in so different ways. Keep that in mind!
